## Groups

A group is an abstract algebraic structure. It is formed if you have:

* A set, G
* An operator on any pair x,y from the set denoted by xy or x•y, otherwise known as the group law 

The set and axiom, noted (G,•) must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:

1. Closure: Ɐ(x,y) in G | x • y is in G
2. Associativity: Ɐ(x,y,z) in G | (x • y) • z = x • (y • z)
3. Identity element: ∃eⱯa in G | e • a = a • e = a
4. Inverse element: ∃xⱯy in G | x • y = y • x = e  

The set has to respect the existence of inverses, closure and identity element

## Monoids

Monoids are defined by being semigroups with the added benefit of respecting the identity element axiom

## Semigroups 

A semigroup is a generalization of a group. It is only formed upon having a set and an operator for which only the Closure and Associativity axioms are true.

## Free monoid/semigroup

Free monoid/semigroup on a set G is respectively a monoid/semigroup whose set is replaced by the string (0...n elements from the set G) and where the operator is string concatenation and if a monoid the identity element is empty string
